If payment is not received by Tuesday, May 24, 2022 on delinquent accounts then service will be disconnected on Wednesday, May 25, 2022.  Do not pay online or by phone on disconnect day because it takes 24 hours to receive those payments.  Call 1-888-585-3161 to make phone payments.  The bill must be paid in full plus a $50 reconnect fee to restore service once it is disconnected.  There will be a $75 reconnect fee for any reconnects not made during normal business hours.  Please disregard this notice if you have already paid your bill.
