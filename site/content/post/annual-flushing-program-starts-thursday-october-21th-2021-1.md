During this time, customers may notice episodes of decreased water pressure or discoloration of their water. Water discoloration results from temporary disturbances of the normal water flow within our distribution system. \

If you experience discolored water, you are encouraged to run cold water through a faucet (bathtubs being the best choice) for 5-10 minutes or until the water clears up.
