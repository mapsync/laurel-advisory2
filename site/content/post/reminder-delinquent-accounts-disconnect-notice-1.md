  delinquent accounts then service will be disconnected on Monday, November 28,
  2022.  Do not pay online or by phone on disconnect day because it takes 24
  hours to receive those payments.  Call 1-888-585-3161 to make phone
  payments.  The bill must be paid in full plus a $25 reconnect fee to restore
  service once it is disconnected.  There will be an $80 reconnect fee for any
  reconnects not made during normal business hours.  There is also a night drop
  on the side of the building for payments made after office hours.  Please
  disregard this notice if you have already paid your bill.
